# About The Project
WellyBelly Health is a web application built with Next and Express used to track health and wellness metrics.
- Direct integration via REST to the USDA Food Database (FoodData Central)
- Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database
- Simple interface design: column sorting, intuitive buttons, and paging

For more information on how to build the Express backend, check out my blog post: [Everywhen Software Blog](https://www.everywhensoftware.com/blog/2023-09-01-Simple-Express/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the `food` page does not load right away, then the Express server may have gone idle. Click on this link and wait until you get a return message (something like `{"message":"Simple Express Server"}`): [Express Server](https://welly-belly-server.onrender.com/). Then try the demo again.

Live demo can be found here: [WellyBelly Health Demo](https://welly-belly-ui.onrender.com).
